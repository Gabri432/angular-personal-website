            <h2>About me</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            My favourite programming language is Java, but I also enjoy Python, Go, and Typescript. <br />
            Among the tools that I use the most there are Angular, Github and VSCode. <br /><br />
            Among my passions there are sports such as Basketball, Olympic Lifting and Rugby. <br />
            Other than that I love Math and Science. <br /><br />
            Other than my native language, italian, I do speak english and little french. <br />
            I can also read some spanish.

# The best games of my life... 
<br /><br />

<br />
Sometimes games are just more than a way to be engaged and find entertainment. Sometimes they give you the <strong>best memories</strong> of your life.
<br /><br />
It might be some nostalgia, but I do think old games were more charming and memorable than the majority of modern generation games.
<br /><br />
Today I want to share some of those masterpieces that I had the privilege to play.
<br /><br />

## Oblivion, the Elder Scrolls 4
I know, I know all the memes, the weird NPCs, the glitches, and all the rest. It aged like milk. It definetely had seen better years, but nevertheless it can still deliver a memorable experience even nowdays.
<br /><br />
Oblivion is an RPG developed by Bethesda in 2006, (2007 the PC version that I played), and while graphically it may not be as much appealing the younger brother Skyrim, I do believe the game offers a better exploring experience.<br />
Cities felt more <strong>unique and interesting</strong>, with each having its own set of missions, landmarks and style.
<br /><br />
Oblivion offers an immersive character development, with skills to learn, guilds to join, potion and spell creation and much more.<br />
But to me, best part of this game was the <strong>music</strong>.
<br /><br />
The music really matched the atmosphere of the game. It fits perfectly to every situation.<br />
Wheter you enter a city, starts a fight or just wonder across the Cyrodill, the music really helped making this game a <strong>true gem</strong>.
<br /><br />

## Simcity 4
I'm still amazed by the <strong>complexity</strong> that this game has.<br />
Simcity 4 is a city simulator develop by EA Maxis in 2003, and offered several features such as traffic management, school management, healthcare management and much more, with a extensive array of tools that help you keeping track of the expansion of your city. 
<br /><br />
I have always liked the idea of creating my ideal city, with good public transportation, a lot of parks, low pollution, high education, stunning skylines. And SimCity 4 really make you feel like a <strong>Major</strong>.
<br />
But it doesn't stop there. Another key aspect was the size of cities. They could be small or really large, and be connected to other cities within the region. And again, the <strong>soundtracks</strong> were all phenomenal.
<br /><br />
Despite lacking the 3d view that modern games have, such as Cities Skylines, I truely believe that it is still worth being played even nowdays.
<br /><br />

## Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag
While far more recent than the aforementioned games, it has been already more than 10 years since its first release, but it still a <strong>must-play</strong>.
<br /><br />
AC4 is an action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft in 2013, and I remember sailing with my crew, while listening to old sea shanties, and thinking how cool of a captain Edward Kenney was.
<br />
I remember defeating all the bosses and feeling <strong>like a boss</strong> myself because my ship was maxed out and I was destroying every enemy I was encountering.<br /><br />
AC4 offers a unique combination of exploring a rich and diverse world, addicting gameplay and interesting NPCs.
<br /><br />
This was by far the best game of Ubisoft in my opinion.
<br /><br />

## Final Fantasy 10
I remember turning on my old PS2 and being excited by the idea of playing several hours of this game until I have defeated a specific boss.<br /><br />
Final Fantasy 10, or FFX, is a JRPG developed by Square Enix in 2001, and I may have played this game 10 or more times even though I've only finished it once, because I used to get angry and frustrated when I lose to the same boss over and over... DAMN YOU SEYMOUR!
<br /><br />
I loved the friendship between the main characters, the world design, the turn-based combat, the leveling system, the boss fights, and again the <strong>soundtracks</strong>.
<br /><br />
I even loved playing that weird sport called Blitzball, I was never really that good but I have to admit that I <strong>enjoyed it even too much</strong>.
<br /><br />

## Empire Earth
Even more engaging than being a Major was being a <strong>Commander</strong>.
<br />
I don't even know where should I start. Empire Earth 1 was simply ahead of its time.
<br /><br />
Empire Earth is a military strategy game developed by Stainless Steel Studios in 2001, and a good amount of my life was spent in front of a computer mainly for this game. I was captured by its complex dimanics. A key component was that the game <strong>expands as you progress</strong> across each age.
<br />
From prehistory to stone age, then bronze age, then middle ages, then modern ages and finally space age, each one bringing new technologies, troops and buildings.
<br /><br />
It was funny to destroy the enemy buildings using the nuclear bombadiers while you were ahead of several ages, to engage in an epic battle ship that could last several hours, to hear the bell ringing and the signal: "WE ARE UNDER ATTACK!" when the enemy attacks you.
<br /><br />
I was fascinated by looking at the buildings and walls evolving graphically while also maintaing their core design.
<br />
And once again the <strong>soundtracks</strong>, some rising the tension anticipating a battle and some other expressing the pure chaos of that same battle.

## Some other Honorable Mentions
While I could name an indefinite number of games of my childhood, I would only list very few other that I think were truly unique and memorable:
<ul>
<li>Sacred 1, an RPG game isometric developed by Ascaron in 2004;</li>
<li>The Sims 2, a life simulator game developed by EA Maxis in 2004</li>;
<li>Tropico 1, a game where you play as the president of the Tropico Island, developed by PopTop Software in 2001;</li>
<li>Rail Tycoon 3, a train manage PopTop Software in 2003;</li>
<li>Freelancer, a space exploration and fighting game developed by Digital Anvil in 2000.</li>
</ul>

## A side note
What makes those games the best you might ask? That would be a great question.<br />
It is not about the graphics, or the performances, where most of the modern games are far beyond this aspects.<br />
It may not even be about those specific games that I mentioned.
<br /><br />
What really makes some old games the best is the passion and the idea of old developers of a game as an experience, rather than a product, and the will to deliver something memorable.

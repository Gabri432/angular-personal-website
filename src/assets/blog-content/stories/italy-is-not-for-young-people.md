**48 years**.<br />
This is the average age of the Italian population, as of today. There are more people going to retirement than students attending school.<br /><br />

In this article we are going to analyze which aspects of Italy make it difficult for young generations to hope for a better future. <br /><br />

## Schools...
The education system has suffered severe **budget cuts** in the last 20 years. As a result, there are fewer (and poorly paid) teachers, disproportionally assigned to too many students. <br /><br />

School buildings often suffer from a lack of maintainance. They are generally old and inaccessible to disabled students.<br />
Mine sometimes didn't even have... **toilet paper**.<br /><br />

Every year, parents are expected to buy several **expansive textbooks**.<br /> 
On average, a school can have 6-7 different subjects, each may also require a workbook in addition to the textbook. A single book may cost 30-50 euros.<br /> That is, per everyone of your child, you may end up spending around 200-300 euros, that could become 1000-1500 euros for the five years of duration of an elementary or high school, <br /><br />

There is a high level of **school dropouts**.<br /> 
Italy ranks at the bottom positions in Europe for percentage of graduated students, as well as students with technological skills. More often than not, newly graduated students struggles to find a job due to the **lack of practical knowledge**.
But this is just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />

## Job Market...
It is often called *Fuga di cervelli*, that is "**Brain drain**", or the common habit for a lot of young graduated people to **go abroad**, looking for better job opportunities.<br /><br />

The Italian job markets is notoriously bad, especially due to **low pay wages** and long working hours.<br /> Most job offers demand for highly experienced workers, which is descouraging for younger generations. An "entry level position" for a software developer may require several months or few years of experience with a lot different technologies.<br /><br />

The vast majority of Italian companies are small sized, with around 10-50 employees, and, consequentially, they cannot afford to train a complete inexperienced worker.<br /><br />

The work environment generally tends to be bad.<br />
The majority of people in Italy **are unsatisfied** with their jobs. Lots of women have experienced some kind of **sexual harassment**, besides being commonly paid less than men. <br /><br />

## Politics...
There is a **lack of trust in politicians**.<br /><br />

Younger generations tend not to go to vote. Many broken promises, incompetency, inefficiencies in recent years have plumbed interest in politics, along with hope for a **better future**.<br />
And for this reason, they have less political relevance. **They count less**.<br /><br />

Conversely, politics doesn't care either. As population as a whole is aging, talking about retirement attracts more support than school or intership regulations.<br /> **This earns parties more votes**. But how can we solve all of this?<br /><br />

## What is possible...
To summarize, Italy has a sctructural problem when it comes to its younger generations.<br />
It is too expensive to start a family, which means couples wanting to have kids would simply put it off until they feel they are in the right financial position. This could happen in their 40s, 50s, 60s or never...<br /><br />

What Italy should consider is to invest more in the education sector. At the time of writing, it represents only 4% of the GDP, while the EU average is around 4.8%.<br /> 
This new fundinf should focus on raising teacher salaries, modernizing school infrastructures, assisting families with purchasing school infrastructure.<br />
But it isn't easy, since Italy has a public debt of 130-140% of the GDP.<br /><br />

Whatever counter-measure the Italian government decides to apply, there is the need to act quickly, otherwise the country may collapse on its retirement system.

<br /><br />

NBA games during the regular season feel meaningless, and I believe the main reason is the number of them.<br />
In this article I'm going to breakdown the benefits of reducing the length of the season.
<br /><br />

## Losses don't matter much
Too many games means the each one <strong>isn't particulary important</strong>. That is, a team can lose several games and still having good chances of making into the playoff.
<br /><br />
This also can results in a overall loss in competiviness

- more meaningful games
- less injury risk
